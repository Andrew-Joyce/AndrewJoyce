<h2 style="background-color:powderblue;"> Personal Profile</h2>

<p style="color:slategray;">The three tests that I took were: 
<p style="color:slategray;"><li style="list-style:square"><a href=https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types> Myers-Briggs 16 personality types</a></li></p>
<p style="color:slategray;"><li style="list-style:square"><a href=https://www.debonogroup.com> DeBono’s Six Thinking Hats</a>: and,</li></p>
<p style="color:slategray;"><li style="list-style:square"><a href=https://http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/>Honey and Mumford Learning Styles</a></li></p> 


<h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>  
<p style="color:slategray;">Based on the results from the test, I took away the key learnings about myself:</p>

<h3>Myer-Briggs</h3> 
<img src="INTJ.jpeg" width="300" Height= "100" Style = "float: right"/>
<p style="color:slategray;">My profile for Myer-Briggs is an INTJ. Based on the results, I've learned that I can operate relatively independently and take a structured approach to my work. I am open-minded, forward-thinking, and take a strategic view on solving problems. With decision making, I like to use data to support the process and can be decisive. </p>
<p style="color:slategray;">From a weakness perspective, I can be over-analytical and can become judgemental. I may become impatient with people when it comes to others making a decision or taking longer to arrive at the same position.</p> 

<h3>White Hat </h3>
<img src="Debono.jpeg" width="200" Height= "75" Style = "float: left"/>
<P style="color:slategray;">Based on Edward Six Thinking Hats thinking style, I am predominately a white hat.</p>
<p style="color:slategray;">As a white hat, my thinking style is unbiased and objective. I look at the facts and statistics to form my views and make decisions. Before concluding, I'll validate and test the data to ensure that I make the right choice.</p> 

<h3>Honey and Mumford's Learning Styles</h3> 
<p style="color:slategray;">My learning style is that of a pragmatist. As a pragmatist, I like to observe and learn in the real world.  I am most likely to be engaged when the objectives and instructions are clear, and I can apply the learnings in practice.</p>
<p style="color:slategray;">I may become impatient when long discussions are focused on theory,  and I cannot practically apply the learnings.</p>

<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h3> 
<p style="color:slategray;">The results from the three tests undertaken will influence my behavior in a team setting. They have made me aware of thinking and learning styles and how they may affect how I need to work with other people in my team.</p>
<p style="color:slategray;">The tests have highlighted personal attributes that I need to be conscious of when working with other people and how potentially I need to adjust my approach when working on a problem in a group setting. </p>
<p style="color:slategray;">Based on my results from the tests, I understand that I can be quite decisive in making decisions when supported by data. In a team setting, I need to acknowledge that other people may need more time to explore a problem through conversation and experience before drawing their conclusions. </p>

<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3> 
<P style="color:slategray;">When forming a team, it is essential to take these results into account. In a team setting, it is crucial to have diverse people to promote debate and look to solve problems from different perspectives. This can help challenge the team and motivate them to work more effectively together to develop solutions. </p>
<p style="color:slategray;">A disadvantage of filling a team with like-minded individuals may limit creativity and the team’s ability to work productively together.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:powderblue;"Project Idea</h2> 
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p style="color:slategray;">My project idea is to create a central web portal/app that people can use after being tested and diagnosed with Covid-19 to apply for financial, well-being and care assistance.</p> 
<p style="color:slategray;">The purpose of this application is to provide people a central contact point to access the support they will need to quarantine for the 14-day mandatory period. The service should provide an individual and their families a seamless experience in applying for the difference assistance they may need throughout this period.</p>  

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p style="color:slategray;">For people tested and diagnosed with Covid-19, it causes an immediate disruption to their lives. People who test positive are required to self-isolate for 14 days to minimise the possible spread of the virus in the community. They are no longer able to work or have access to basic necessities needed to support themselves through this period.</p>
<p style="color:slategray;">Both the Federal and State governments have put in place support packages to assist people through this period. The processes to access these services are disparate for the average person. They can be streamlined and simplified to reduce the stress of the situation.</p> 

<h3>Description</h3> 
<p style="color:slategray;">Outlined below is the process that a person would follow to access Federal and State assistance following taking a Covid-19 test.</p> 

<p style="color:slategray;"><b>1.	Test for Covid-19</b></p> 
<p style="color:slategray;">As part of taking a Covid-19 test, a patient provides their contact details for their results. The details include their name, address, email, and phone number.</p>
<p style="color:slategray;">Once completed, the patient is handed a unique identifier from the medical officer who administered the test and information material relating to the 14-day quarantine period.</p> 
<p style="color:slategray;">The information material will reference the new web portal/app to register for Federal and State government assistance.</p> 

<p style="color:slategray;"><b>2.	Request Support</b></p>
<p style="color:slategray;">Following receiving the information, the patient can register online via a website or mobile app for assistance. </p>
<p style="color:slategray;">The following information is to be captured as part of the registration process: </p>
<p style="color:slategray;">The unique identifier provided by the medical officer </li><p>
<li style="list-style:square; color:slategray;">Name </li>
<li style="list-style:square; color:slategray;">Address </li>
<li style="list-style:square; color:slategray;">Email: and,</li>
<li style="list-style:square; color:slategray;">Government ID (license or passport number) </li>
<li style="list-style:square; color:slategray;">The details will be verified to confirm the identity. </li>
<p style="color:slategray;">Following confirmation of their identity, the site will list out the assistance they can receive before or after their diagnosis is confirmed.</p>
<p style="color:slategray;">If the patient is eligible for any financial assistance, they will nominate the bank account details to receive their payment. </p>

<p style="color:slategray;"><b>3.	Diagnosis Confirmed</b></p>
<p style="color:slategray;">For those patients who have registered for support, their requests will be electronically directed to the appropriate government agencies once a diagnosis is confirmed. </p>
<p style="color:slategray;">If the diagnosis is negative, there is no further action and their details will be deleted within 24 hours. </p>
<p style="color:slategray;"><b>4.	Receive Support</b></p>
<p style="color:slategray;">Text and email notifications will be sent to the patient upon their requests for support being registered with all the appropriate government agencies.</p>  
<p style="color:slategray;"><b>Text Message</b></p>
<p style="color:slategray;">The text message will provide a brief summary to confirm that their requests have been actioned. It will also confirm that further information relating to the assistance they will receive will be provided by email. 
<p style="color:slategray;"><b>Email</b></p> 
<p style="color:slategray;">The email confirmation will provide the following information in detail:</p> 
<p style="color:slategray;"><b>1. Financial Support </b></p>
<p style="color:slategray;">An itemised summary of the payments they are entitled to receive, the agencies who will make the payments, the amount of each payment, and the date they will be paid. </p>
<p style="color:slategray;"><b>2.	Medical Certificate </b></p>
<p style="color:slategray;">A PDF medical certificate that the patient can supply to their workplace or education service to excuse them from attendance</p> 
<p style="color:slategray;"><b>3.	Health and Support services </b></p>
<p style="color:slategray;">A summary of support services available to the patient throughout the quarantine period to help manage their well-being </p>
<p style="color:slategray;"><b>4.	Necessities package </b></p>
<p style="color:slategray;">A link to a distribution supplier, where a patient can order the necessities (bread, milk, toilet paper) they may require immediately to support themselves while quarantined.</p>
